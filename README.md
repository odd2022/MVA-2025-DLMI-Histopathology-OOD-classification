# MVA-2025-DLMI-Histopathology-OOD-classification
Kaggle Challenge with Garance GÃ©rard for the course Deep Learning For Medical Imaging. The goal was to maximise the accuracy of a binary classification task on hispatology patches. 
This repository consists of two files: 
1) a notebook which presents the approach which the highest accuracy (and different preprocessing techniques)(accuracy: 0.98977)
2) a pdf report which explains how we tackled the challenge.
